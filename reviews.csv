They offer great value compared to many other brands in the market.Cons:1. Limited Noise Isolation: While the earphones provide decent passive noise isolation, they may not completely block out external sounds in noisy environments. Users seeking a more immersive experience might want to consider noise-canceling options.2. Cable Durability: Although the cable is tangle-free, it might be prone to wear and tear with heavy usage. Care should be taken to avoid pulling or bending it excessively.3. Sound Signature: The bass-heavy sound signature may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those who prefer a more balanced sound profile. It might overpower mids and highs in certain music genres.4. No Inline Controls: While the microphone is handy for calls, there are no inline controls for volume or playback, which can be inconvenient for some users.Overall:The boAt Bassheads 100 in Ear Wired Earphones (Furious Red) are an excellent choice for anyone seeking quality sound and comfort at an affordable price. With impressive bass, a stylish design, and a comfortable fit, they‚Äôre perfect for daily use.

So without hesitation I got this product stringz 38 lite in green colour. The sound for half in ear design is pretty amazing. Bass is awesome not overpowering and of course not disappointing at all. The call clarity is also great given the placement of mic is nearer to mouth. Durability - 10/10 other products at this price has a thin wire but this has comparatively thick wire. Connectivity - 10/10 it is seamless and given that mic is nearer to mouth one can hear clearly on the other side.Comfort - 10/10 the half in ear design is intelligently designed by ambrane. If you see other brands, they are alike to apple's earpods but this one has a unique touch to it - the extended outlet near speaker grill that allows sound to direct in ears without much loss and also protecting the speaker grill from accumulating ear wax - this is seriously a clever implementation by ambrane.Volume control - It doesn't have any volume control button but at any volume you listen to given that phone nowadays don't go above recommended volume level unless manually permitted, this absence isn't a deal breaker at all.Portability - 10/10 You can easily carry this in your travel organiser bag or in pocket without worry. Of course according to the condition like crowded buses or trains one has to take precautionary measure out of discernment to protect their earphones it can be the most strongest earphone but if proper care is taken it will last longer to serve you and your needs you see! ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Active Black),3,4,"This is a product review after using it for straight 2 hours since it just got delivered today.What an improvement firstly from the boat bassheads 225.Now, i dont know what the other negative reviews are about since i personally did not find any issue whatsoever with these infact i am delighted by it.If you are looking a for a good wired earphone and dont want to spend much then this would be the best budget earphone in the market right now.Firstly speaking of the body it is plastic and not metallic and so it has become lighter than the previous bassheads so much that after using it for 2 straight hours i almost forgot i had them put on. I just felt the wire could have been a bit thicker but dont forget the wire is braided and coated with a rubber like material which should resolve that dilemma.These come with ear hooks which to my surprise were so comfortable. I usually hate ear hooks cause they hurt after a while but these are just so soft and fit right in.Moving on the main purpose and the bigger question ""BASS"".I would say it's perfect.The sound quality is so very crisp and clear.BASS is in the right spot and according to me you dont need anymore.You may hear from other reviewers the BASS is not as good as the previous bassheads please understand it depends on what kind of music you listen and mostly the KBPS which is kilo bits per second. The higher the kbps the better the sound including bass and treble.The loudness is great almost deafening at the highest volume.To check noise cancellation (although these earphones dont say noise cancellation) I made a few phone calls and asked if they heard any background noise and they said they could hear little to nothing of whats happening in the background. Now ofcourse this is in a normal environment and may not cancel the traffic sounds or a loud background noise.The added advantage is the IPX4 sweat and water resistance (you dont find this feature in most wired earphones atleast not in this price range) which is great specially when you work out or when you are jogging or talking a walk. Although since it is wired you will find discomfort and so may want to get wireless bluetooth earphones instead.So heres how i would rate it on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.Price: 5Build Quality: 4.5 ( Only cause i think the wire could have been a little thicker)Loudness: 5Call Quality: 5Bass: 5 (The bass is just perfect if any more bass than this you'd better be putting your ears on a  loudspeaker).Hope this clarifies your doubts about this product.All in all yet another great product from BOAT and you wont regret the purchase.",2025-01-30 12:22:04

boAt Bassheads 152 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Active Black),1,5,"I would like to start by saying I'm not an audiophile, therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product. First off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, it's good enough that I will buy it a third time if need be!Upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. More on this later.Coming to the ear phones itself, it's among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. It is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. This is not the case with these.The wire itself is made of rubber/silicon. It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasn't showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire. This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.Remember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal? Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. I don't know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didn't affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.Mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience. In my opinion I feel that the quality is average, it won't blow anyone's mind but it will deliver most of the time. A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152Finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. As I said earlier I won't be going into the technical details . I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be. The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half it's total volume when listening to music. The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much. A point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. This becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. The find unlike the ones find in let's say the newer Bose ear phones aren't as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.Last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red, black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.Pros:1) No metal build2) Excellent wire quality and trendy3) Durable4) Above average sound qualityCons:1) Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2) Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3) Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome.Thanking you, Dwarakesh",2025-01-30 12:22:14

I ordered it in June 2021. Today is May 19, 2024. It's still working. Let's review it under various aspects.Mic quality: I have two earphones, this one and the famous realme buds 2. Realme buds 2 comes towards more of sound clarity (trable) and thin voice, so sometimes when you listen full bass songs you'll be disappointed with its base. Where as, boat bassheads 152, is the earphone which gives the perfect balance of voice clarity like realme and signature bass of boat. Believe me I have used this earphone for more than 2.5 years. And it's still giving the same experience.Portability: 4.8 out of 5. You can keep it in pocket, purse, bag etc without worrying about its wire.Fit: 5 out of 5. It has the perfect angle to fit in your ears.Durability: Here I can write an essay, but in short just buy it. June 2021 to may 2024, i am still counting and update when it stops working from any side. Ofc you'll see the tape I have used to protect its wire, which was necessary after use of 1.5 years as it's wire is not fully braded, so you need to take care of upper portion near the eartips. It's 6 months and 10 days using realme buds 2, it's one side has stopped working, I am disappointed because it has fully braded wires, still it fails to impress in terms durability.Comfort and ease of use: 5 out of 5, extremely light weight and easy to fit in your ears, if you are using heavy earphones then you'll love how light it is for your ears. Your ear will thank you for buying it.No product is perfectCons1. You have to take care of upper portion of the wire which is not braded.2. It doesn't easily tangle, but after use of 1 year you'll get trouble in un-tangle it.3. If you compare it with premium earphones then yes its mic quality is not as good as those, but in the range 500-700 this gives one of the best mic quality.4. Unfortunately, poor noise cancellation. I don't mind it btw.I can't even think about the others cons because I am fond of this earphone.",2025-01-30 12:22:14

I thought I could contact the ambrane service team about the problem. I didn't get a response by email AT ALL. I contacted them through WhatsApp and they finally responded. They wanted me to send the earphone packed with the original box and all accessories by courier to Delhi, as they don't have a service centre anywhere else in India. I love in Bangalore, and most companies have a branch here. Anyway, I asked them if they would reimburse the courier cost, and they said not until they have examined the earphones and concluded that it is a manufacturing defect. I was not willing to hassle this much for a cheap earphone and got an IEM with removable cables (I don't like Over ears as my ears get very sweaty), as they seem to be the primary point of failure. I got the KZ ZST, for around ‚Çπ1200, if anyone wants to know.Original: I got these for around ‚Çπ170. For the price, the sounded good enough. Don't expect too much bass. The mic quality is decent as well. They were also one of the only comfortable to wear in ear earphones I've tried.But the main thing these guys skimp on to get to the price is the build quality. Within three days of usage, the metal cylinder around the 3.5mm jack fell off.In about two months, the wire or the jack has already suffered from loose contact and I've lost the mic and left ear signal.

Care should be taken to avoid pulling or bending it excessively.3. Sound Signature: The bass-heavy sound signature may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those who prefer a more balanced sound profile.

I think I am eligible to write this review. I received it on 21 October and today is 29 October and the battery is still at 50%. I know it's crazyyyyyzzyy. I regret why I didn't bought it sooner. Doesn't have heavenly sound like 50k headphones but it's has Nuclear generated Battery. which you will need to charge only 4to5 times a month.Bike rideIt's not ideal for bike riding, it's for indoor use, alot of wind noise when riding, but no wind noise when plugged inside the helmet, additionally it makes alot of noise when you touch the earphone wire, the noise is not from the speaker btwbatteryBattery is great, no question about it. It's been 8 day's, I use it everyday and carry it everywhere and still it has 50% battery. after 8 days continuous used.Sound loudnessThe sound is loud I Don't recommend anyone to use it more than 80% level unless you want to lose your hearing within a year. 40% sound level satisfy me. It's too loud. If you put it more than 80% it's too dangerous for the eardrum.lastingI Don't expect to last it more than 1 year, like every boat earphone i have bought previously. ( they can last only 1 year maximum which is kind of disappointing.)  it's like boat earphone are built to last exactly 1 years. which makes you buy again and again. Which of course  makes sense. if they build a earphone that last forever. they won't be able to sell their newly launched product anymore.lookit looks good when you put it around the neck without listening. but when you put it in your ear it doesn't look cool ( around public) if you want to look cool this is not the right choice for you üòÅCan connect 2 blutooth device at the same timeBut the problem is, it can't recognise which is yours and which isn't, so when someone near you turn on their bluetooth, it will directly connect to it. which is kind of a minor problem. but i suppose boat apps can fixed it.sound qualitysound quality is kind of in the middle, I Don't have complains, but it's far better than 500 rs wired earphone IMO. the bass has high beat sound. mids and treble are perfect for me, bass is too much for me, IDK About your opinion.Noise block (ANC)If you play music to 30-40% sound level, you won't hear anyone talking near you. but if you Don't play any music, the noise level is blocked around 10% i would say. Considering this doesn't have any ANC it's great.i will update after 1,2,3 months used.",2025-01-30 12:22:37

"Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic, Bombastic Bass - 12.4 mm Drivers, 10 Mins Charge - 20 Hrs Music, 30 Hrs Battery Life, IP55 Dust and Water Resistant (Magico Black)",1,5,"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.Connectivity & Ease of Use:Let‚Äôs start with one of the essentials‚Äîconnectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It‚Äôs the kind of convenience you don‚Äôt realize you need until you have it.Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use‚Äîthink about 1-2 hours daily‚Äîyou can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you‚Äôre a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver‚Äîjust 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those ‚Äúoops, I forgot to charge them‚Äù moments.Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn‚Äôt disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there‚Äôs no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn‚Äôt connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you‚Äôre using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would‚Äôve been a nice touch.Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters‚Äîgood sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won‚Äôt have you constantly reaching for the charger. It‚Äôs not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it‚Äôs hard not to appreciate the value you get.If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.",2025-01-30 12:22:47
"Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic, Bombastic Bass - 12.4 mm Drivers, 10 Mins Charge - 20 Hrs Music, 30 Hrs Battery Life, IP55 Dust and Water Resistant (Magico Black)",2,5,"There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand‚Äôs audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.",2025-01-30 12:22:47
