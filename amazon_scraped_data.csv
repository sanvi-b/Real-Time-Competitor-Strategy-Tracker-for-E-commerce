The Type-C jack is very convenient for my phone, and the sound quality, especially the clear vocals, is impressive for casual listening. The earphones are lightweight and come with simple in-line controls, making it easy to manage calls and music. While the bass isn’t as powerful as I expected, it’s still decent for regular use. The build quality could be better, but overall, these earphones are a great budget-friendly option for anyone looking for basic functionality and good sound."

I think I am eligible to write this review. I received it on 21 October and today is 29 October and the battery is still at 50%. I know it's crazyyyyyzzyy. I regret why I didn't bought it sooner. Doesn't have heavenly sound like 50k headphones but it's has Nuclear generated Battery. which you will need to charge only 4to5 times a month.Bike rideIt's not ideal for bike riding, it's for indoor use, alot of wind noise when riding, but no wind noise when plugged inside the helmet, additionally it makes alot of noise when you touch the earphone wire, the noise is not from the speaker btwbatteryBattery is great, no question about it. It's been 8 day's, I use it everyday and carry it everywhere and still it has 50% battery. after 8 days continuous used.Sound loudnessThe sound is loud I Don't recommend anyone to use it more than 80% level unless you want to lose your hearing within a year. 40% sound level satisfy me. It's too loud. If you put it more than 80% it's too dangerous for the eardrum.lastingI Don't expect to last it more than 1 year, like every boat earphone i have bought previously. ( they can last only 1 year maximum which is kind of disappointing.)  it's like boat earphone are built to last exactly 1 years. which makes you buy again and again. Which of course  makes sense. if they build a earphone that last forever. they won't be able to sell their newly launched product anymore.lookit looks good when you put it around the neck without listening. but when you put it in your ear it doesn't look cool ( around public) if you want to look cool this is not the right choice for you 😁Can connect 2 blutooth device at the same timeBut the problem is, it can't recognise which is yours and which isn't, so when someone near you turn on their bluetooth, it will directly connect to it. which is kind of a minor problem. but i suppose boat apps can fixed it.sound qualitysound quality is kind of in the middle, I Don't have complains, but it's far better than 500 rs wired earphone IMO. the bass has high beat sound. mids and treble are perfect for me, bass is too much for me, IDK About your opinion.Noise block (ANC)If you play music to 30-40% sound level, you won't hear anyone talking near you. but if you Don't play any music, the noise level is blocked around 10% i would say. Considering this doesn't have any ANC it's great.i will update after 1,2,3 months used."

First off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, it's good enough that I will buy it a third time if need be!Upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. More on this later.Coming to the ear phones itself, it's among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. It is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. This is not the case with these.The wire itself is made of rubber/silicon. It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasn't showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire. This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.Remember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal? Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. I don't know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didn't affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.Mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience. In my opinion I feel that the quality is average, it won't blow anyone's mind but it will deliver most of the time. A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152Finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. As I said earlier I won't be going into the technical details . I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be. The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half it's total volume when listening to music. The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much. A point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. This becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. The find unlike the ones find in let's say the newer Bose ear phones aren't as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.Last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red, black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.Pros:1) No metal build2) Excellent wire quality and trendy3) Durable4) Above average sound qualityCons:1) Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2) Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3) Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome.Thanking you, Dwarakesh"
